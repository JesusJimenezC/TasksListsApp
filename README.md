# React Todo-List App

This is a front-end project for a Todo-List application built with React, Chakra UI, TanStack Query, TanStack Router, and Recoil. The app allows you to manage multiple lists of todos, where you can create list containers for organizing your tasks, edit list names, delete entire lists along with their associated todos, create new todos, delete them, and update their details.

## Features

- Create multiple lists to organize your tasks.
- Edit the name of a list to give it a meaningful title.
- Delete a complete list along with all the todos it contains.
- Create new todos and associate them with specific lists.
- Delete individual todos when they are no longer needed.
- Update the details of a todo, such as the title or completion status.

## Technologies Used
